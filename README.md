# jake.love
A little love game I'm playing with!

## Running

1. Install love from https://love2d.org
2. On unix-y systems, you can run [generate_love.sh](generate_love.sh) and run jake.love in build/
3. Otherwise, try
    $ love . # from the top directory
    
I don't really use windows so I'm not really sure what to do there :( sorry.
